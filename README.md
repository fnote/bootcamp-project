# Bootcamp-project

***integration of frontend and backend and the login is yet to be done***

This project contains a basic setup to develop a POS system 

All client side code is inside the client directory .frontend is developed with react and reactstrap (reactstrap is used for components)

Root folder will host the server side code   

An express server is used along with mongo for the database   
mLab a mongoDB database as a service is used as the database here 


# Lets set things up 

clone the project  

run an npm install from the root folder to download the server side dependencies  

go to the client folder with cd client   

run another npm install to get client side dependencies   

'npm run dev'  from the root folder will fire up both the frontend and the backend concurrently  

 'npm run start'  from the root folder will start the server alone  
 
'npm run client'  will fire up the client alone   

'npm run server'  will fire up a live server that watches changes continously and update accordingly
